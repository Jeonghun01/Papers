This paper is about a model as known as Transformer

It is difficult to train model with real data on my local environment, so i did testing model(Encoder and Decoder) and wrote just train code, you can check these at other files
On model test, it worked great and had expected results

Still, i should make positional encoding
but, on paper, without pe it got a quite good BLEU score 25.7 so that i will do it later
