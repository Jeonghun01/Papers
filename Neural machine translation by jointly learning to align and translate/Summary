On paper they use WMT ’14 dataset that contains the following English-French parallel corpora: Europarl (61M words), news
commentary (5.5M), UN (421M) and two crawled corpora of 90M and 272.5M words respectively, totaling 850M words.

It is a litte hard to work on local environment cause of dataset so that on this realization i focus on test Encoder-Decoder.
Check the test.ipynb file please

And also, on paper, when they made model they used some specific formulas on units similar with LSTM, but i use simple RNN Unit.
