1. MSA representation
FASTA File -> raw MSA(s, r) -> Embedding -> MSA representation (s, r, c)
s = # proteins
r = # amino-acids
c = # features (amino-acid) = 64

2. Pair representation
MSA -> (r, r, c)
r = # amino-acids
c = r-r feature (distance) = 64

After train test, will do data engineering
Detailed Algorithms are on SI 1.2 - 1.5
